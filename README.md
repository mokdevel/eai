### Current Build: 0.10

#### Current Features

- AI patrols
- Formations and group behavior
- Targeting, aiming, and basic weapon handling (firing, reloading, etc)

#### In Progress & Wishlist Features

- Advanced Weapon Handling (Unjamming, fire modes, single shot reloading, mag repack)
- Melee combat
- Actual ballistics computation (or find a way to inject the engine ballistics)
- More loadout features, possible integration with Expansion loadouts
- Combat movement (crouching, repositioning, etc)
- Map markers and patrol manager
- Resupply (ability to pick up items on ground)
- Stamina, incapacitation, blood loss

#### Known Issues

- Entering network bubble while AI starts combat may break the aiming stream sometimes
- Without a headless client, aiming performance is worse over a high-ping or jittery network
- Performance as a whole can be improved
